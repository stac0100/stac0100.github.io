            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> <strong>Who am I?</strong> First and foremost, I am a daughter and a sister, in fact, I am the youngest sibling out of <em>five</em> (the 5<sup>th</sup> sibling).
                 I am, also, a student at <em> Algonquin College </em> in the <strong> <abbr title = "Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr></strong> program. I have spent time in other programs and courses discovering my interests and
                 gaining knowledge and am <em>happy</em> to have decided on this program. 

            <p> Aside from school, I work part time at a local cafe, <strong> Madwaska Coffee Co.</strong>. 
                During this time, I get to make lots of <em>cool</em> drinks such as; lattes, mochas, flat whites, cappuccinos, etc. 
                Additionally, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to make meaningful connections with my <em>community</em> and <em>coworkers</em>.  </p>
